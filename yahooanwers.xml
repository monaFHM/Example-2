        <Subject>How can I get from Berlin to KÃ¶ln as cheaply as possible?</Subject>
        <Content>Me and some friends are going to the Jay-Z and Kanye West concert in KÃ¶ln. I&#039;ve looked around but the train/flight fares are just way too expensive. Does anyone have an idea on how to get to KÃ¶ln from Berlin at a really, really low cost?

Thanks a lot!
I&#039;m doing a project on the things I would do if I went to Cologne, Germany and I&#039;m trying to like, sell it I guess you could say? Like, if Cologne was an object. I&#039;m trying to get people to visit there.

        <Subject>How long should I stay in KÃ¶ln, Germany?</Subject>
        <Content>The thing is, i&#039;m going by train to it to see my brother. (I&#039;m 17, he&#039;s doing his stage and is 21). I won&#039;t see him during the day, so I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s worth going early because I won&#039;t see him much as he&#039;ll be working? 
I can go the second week of holidays, from tuesday to monday. But I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s anything I can do alone that will be fun?


Is it a dangerous city?


Thanks!

        <ChosenAnswer>Any city in Germany is a lot safer than any place in the US that said just don&#039;t do anything stupid and use common sense.

In KÃ¶ln there are a lot of things to do and visit depending on your interests.

Be aware when traveling to Germany you are still a minor and for this reason you need a letter of your parents that they are ok with you traveling alone and also they need to name a person who is legally responsible for you during your stay ( that can be your brother for example).

I join some sites about Cologne which might be of help.</ChosenAnswer>

        <ChosenAnswer>Sion&#039;s a good place.  Farmer&#039;s is good, too--ate there almost every time I drove up to Koln.  The central Christmas Market should be over by the 24th, but it might still be rather busy and crowded in the cathedral square anyway... and some places might be closed because it&#039;s Christmas Eve.  Either way, the Dom (cathedral) area, or possibly Neumarkt, are the best places to check first.</ChosenAnswer>

        <Subject>Piece of typographic art in Ludwig Museum KÃ¶ln?</Subject>
        <Content>It was quite a while ago when I went to the Ludwig Museum in KÃ¶ln (Cologne), Germany.  There was, however, a piece of large typographic art with physical letters, at least I think it was.  It was probably 15 feet by 15 feet large, and it had black letters and it may have been suspended.  at any rate, does anyone know what this piece was or what the words actually say?  Thank you.
